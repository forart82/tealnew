"21","1","11","Il n'y a rien d'intrinsèquement ""meilleur"" d'être à un stade de développement plus élevé, comme un adolescent n'est pas ""meilleur"" qu'un jeune nourrisson. Néanmoins, le fait reste qu'un adolescent est capable de faire plus, car il ou elle peut penser d'une manière plus sophistiquée qu'un jeune nourrisson. Tous les stades de développement sont "" okay"". La question est plutôt de savoir si le stade de développement est en bonne adéquation avec la tache demandée."
"22","2","11","There is nothing inherently ""better"" being at a higher stage of development, as an adolescent is not ""better"" than a young infant. However, the fact remains that a teenager is able to do more because he or she can think in a more sophisticated way than a young infant. All stages of development are ""ok"". The question is rather knowing if the stage of development matches with the requested task."
